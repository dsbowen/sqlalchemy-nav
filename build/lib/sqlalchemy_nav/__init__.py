"""Mixins for SQLAlchemy-Nav

SQLAlchemy-Nav Mixins can be used to create dynamic navigation bar models 
compatible with Bootstrap. Navigation bars may contain a brand, navigation 
items, dropdown items, and custom html.

All models contain a url and a label. Brands and Navitems are nested in 
Navbars, and Dropdownitems are nested in Navitems.
